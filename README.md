# Overview
If you are a pet owner or veterinarian, you may have wondered about the optimal nutritional requirements for dogs and cats. Questions like "How many calories does my pet need?" or "What's the best feeding schedule?" are common concerns. Using Java, we developed a comprehensive program to calculate daily caloric requirements and feeding schedules for pets based on their specific characteristics.

My project calculates the Maintenance Energy Requirements (MER) for dogs and cats, taking into account factors such as spaying/neutering status, weight, and activity level. I have implemented scientific formulas used in veterinary nutrition and created personalized feeding schedules tailored to each pet's needs.

## About the Program
The program includes calculations for PPG (Pets' Nutritional Guidelines) data for dogs and cats obtained using established veterinary formulas. Each class contains specific methods that calculate nutritional requirements based on: 'Weight', 'Spaying/Neutering Status', and 'Activity Level' (for dogs). All calculations are based on scientific formulas and considered as primary veterinary nutritional guidelines.

## Using the Program
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your computer

Text Editor or IDE (such as VS Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse, or Notepad++)

## Step-by-Step Instructions
1: Download and Set Up the Files
Create a new folder called "petpal" on your computer

2: Save all three Java files in the "petpal" folder:

  MyPetPalDriver.java
  
  CatClass.java
  
  DogClass.java

3: Open in IDE
